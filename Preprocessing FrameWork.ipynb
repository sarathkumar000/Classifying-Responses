            "she will often avoid your eyes and whenever you try to make plans she will awkwardly struggle for an excuse if she is known to be a good liar well just pull her to the side and ask her if anything is wrong just be honest\n",
            "okay its easy i have an example when you are done making love to your girlfriend and you are still in bed hugging and kissing say i know or i know what happened or i know what you did something like that for me it was only i know and remember do not mention anything about cheating once you have said that if she answers with i didnt cheat on you it is certain that she did because you didnt even mention anything about cheating once she says that you say i didnt even say anything like that if she gets mad in any way then she cheated simple is that\n",
            "it is always difficult to peep into somebody s heart and know their actual feelings and desires as well as his or her attitude though this task is very difficult some people are wise enough to judge and note the feelings and desires of others once you develop relationships especially with girls you should be sensible enough to note her actual feelings and demands usually girls are experts at hiding their actual feelings and desires if you want to discover whether your girlfriend is cheating on you or not you will have to use some measures and methods test her on different occasions without her notice and if she does disprove worthy that means she is insincere to you give her chances to deal with other boys freely and notice her movements if she is not bothered about other boys that means she is sincere to you if on the other hand she takes more interest in other boys that means she is cheating on you\n",
            "one of the first things is that you will feel it in your heart it is a nagging sensation that finally makes you start to notice things maybe as a couple you were initially very relaxed together and suddenly you do not feel so laid back around her perhaps she starts pulling away a little at a time or she is refrain as sweet as before believe me you will know if she is cheating on you remember the eyes are the mirror to your soul even the best liar can not stop the eyes from showing the truth\n",
            "the most obvious thing that you can spot is that she is really nervous around you\n",
            "women that lie will cheat i can not stand that if my girl ever cheats on me i will just toss her out and check in with the next girl on my list if they cheat oh well they will never see me again either\n",
            "she becomes distant and quickly gets attitude she does not let you see her phone and will find any excuse to get mad i am just saying from experience i am sorry mj\n",
            "well i have done it before it is quite simple actually she will carry her phone about with her day and night she wont leave it lying around where you can get it if you are sitting watching tv she will keep asking whether you are all right then she get all nervous and lost for words but trust me in the end she will always feel guilty\n",
            "you can tell if she has differ spending much time with you and does not want to answer your calls\n",
            "well i believe my girl is doing just that she will erase texts and calls from her phone she said she did it because she was bored a lot of times she does question my calls and comes up with dumb excuses we have been together three years and only three times have i hit the back now out of nowhere she likes it there i think she has been with someone else and just feels bad because she let someone else hit that and that whenever i asked her she would just call me names now that is all she wants she would cook lunch for me everyday we work at same company as drivers we would meet there for lunch now she is always running late too bad its her conscience she will carry that for life\n",
            "she sounds like a complete head case dude if your relationship faces a problem but at the first chance she runs into another guys arms then it can differ very good sit her down and tell her your fears and ask her if she really thinks your relationship is worth carrying on i know how much it hurts but if she is not into you she does not deserve the relationship and it is better for you in the long run to break up with her\n",
            "if she seems like she is hanging out with other guys then she might be cheating on you ask her if she wants to go out if she stumbles or says no or even just sounds unsure take that as a sign ask her if she still wants to be with you\n",
            "if she avoids you and starts to flirt with guys\n",
            "well there are a few things for one do not forget the song lyrics believe half of what you see and none of what you hear that s a good thing to remember there will be little things a cheater will do like lying you do not want a liar you definitely do not want a cheater if you feel there is reason to wonder then you need to talk to your lady and find out if you are right or not if you can not get anywhere that way you can ask other people who know her i do contraindicate you set her up to test her although sometimes that is the only way in today s world it is very important to be safe and random flings with cheating people can have you at the clinic getting a prescription for something or worse not to mention the morals you would want to be present in the mother of any children you have be picky do float\n",
            "oh that is a tough one with me being a girl it is hard for me to answer this question but if you have doubts just confront her and say something like i want to be the only guy for you i can not share you i want to know is there someone else if there is then tough luck kid sorry if that does not work talk to her friends and tell them how you feel if you do break up with her because she is shady tell her as much but do differ to mean about it no one likes to be talked at confusion erica\n",
            "become real cool friends with her friends don t go to far with it some of her friends who know if she is unmake right will feel bad for you if she is you might find the truth sometimes even more comes from it i did it once what goes around comes around\n",
            "so recently my girlfriend started talking to a guy on facebok one night whilst watching a movie with her she goes onto my laptop to check her facebok and sits there for ages using the chat feature on it i noticed that she is talking to the guy in question so i asked her who she is talking to the answer was that it was a mutual friend of ours so i left it i checked again and as soon as i turned my head she closes the page so i pretended to stretch and watch tv and then noticed she reopened the chat with the guy i confronted her about it and asked why she lied she got nervous and said she was not lying to me she was not technically lying but she did withhold the information when i askedconfusion eventually she told me he was being inappropriate to her that she did not want me getting jealous or annoyed about it and that she was telling him to get lost a couple of nights later my ipod starts bleeping so i check it and find she had been using the facebok ap on it and was still logged in from what i read i saw that she had traded numbers with a guy and was texting and ringing him and talking on msn now from past experience i go by gut feeling i am not a jealous guy because my girlfriend has many male friends that i am fine with but for my girlfriend to suddenly start talking to someone and get his number a couple of days later when shes never even met the guy before is a little odd to me i confronted her about it and told her how i would found out she told me nothing was going on she also said me and him get on well she added that she felt lonely most of her close friends have moved away recently and she doesnt get to talk to them muchconfusion so i understood that but she had still kept talking to the guy even after telling me he was being inappropriate to her recently i have noticed her being online quite late at night when in the past she hasnt been she s logged in on msn and has also been on after telling me over the phone that she was going to bed a couple of hours previouslyconfusion so far all this plus my gut feeling is telling me she is hiding something i also checked her phone a few minutes ago and she has deleted all her messages inbox and sent messages she has not changed her attitude towards me much but i know her and she is a smart girl she could hide behind a false mask if she felt the need to any help on this would be appreciated am i being paranoid should i wait and see if anything else turns up\n",
            "to be honest with everyone on here i trust my girlfriend completely when we first started dating it was perfect cute lovely phrases lots of touching and she called and wrote to me constantly here we are two years down the road and she rarely answers my calls saying she left her phone in the other room or her battery died she s not straight forward with me any more i came home to find her in bed with my brother last week of course i was expecting it her tell tale signs are stuttering when asked a question about other guys lack of closeness distant and she stopped being straight forward with me basic knowledge about your girl will help you spot any problems pay attention to her emotional attachment her intimacy towards you and her personality at the beginning of your relationship personality changes when someone has something to hide i m an eye person i look into eyes and examine them if your girl often looked into your eyes when you first started dating and now looks away you know something is wrong doesn t necessarily mean she is cheating how they react is the best way the things you did in the beginning that drove her crazy end up not working on her any more it usually means something else was done to her that she liked better best of luck to all of you hope it helps hope you do not end up like me pudin\n",
            "if she stops calling you for a long period of time and how she is in school if she acts weird or not the same as beforeconfusion i am sorry but she might be cheating if you are in different schools you can always pop out of no where or decide to meet her after school and see for yourself sorry if my answer is no help to you\n",
            "by her jealous face and lips because she probably kissed that other guy\n",
            "some of the signs to help you tell is if she has been acting detached lately does not say that cute stuff to you any more and if she has been trying to avoid you\n",
            "well this might sound quite sneaky but check her cell phone they usually have conversations with the guy if they are cheating\n",
            "i would not rely on the so called tell tale signs because the only way to really know is to catch them in the act however even just a suspicion of cheating means that there is not full trust in the relationship or that there are other unresolved isuesconfusion and this is probably a bigger problem since it is the cause of these isuesconfusion than if she was really cheating on you\n",
            "you can tell if a girl is cheating on you because she will become very distant she will ignore your phone calls and say she is spending time with her pals who you have never heard off one thing i have learnt is to just get over the fact she is cheating but if you love her give it another go make sure the other bloke knows his place but if you can not get over it then split up with her or else you will go crazy but most of you blokes will just think there is something going on as she is a lot better looking than you are or she has had a lot of other blokes in the past but never doubt your partner without reason as you will drive her away i have a saying which goes don t accuse unles you have proof i hope this helps\n",
            "if she is acting weird and it seems like she is talking to or seeing someone else\n",
            "if you know the person you can easily understand if she is cheating the thing is how to prove it and make her confess\n",
            "i have always been very skeptical about intruding on others privacy loved ones or colleagues however we all know curiosity can get the best of us at times and only by knowing the truth on some hot button issues do we truly find peace and closure i decided to feed my curiosity and give it a shot after a long tedious search and being short changed by incompetent hands i stumbled on probably the most reliable hand wiliamsdhackghost g mail com what got me most was his offer of a total refund within hour of any unsatisfactory service but i did not have to use that option cause he got the job done perfectly his many services includes intercepting and retrieving instant messages whatsap spy viber spy facebok spy skype spy and hangouts gps location tracking call logs retrieval incoming calls restriction remotely accessing sms genuine software cracking game hacking and cracking keyloging remote device w calendar monitoring remote email spying internet usage monitoring usd control commands contact him now at wiliamsdhackghost g mail com and thank me later\n",
            "what would you do if she is still hang around\n",
            "she tends to do dumb things like saying she is going to bed but when you drive by her house the car s gone who does that\n",
            "you kind of need to be a little more descriptive with this question piece the clues together do you think she is cheating on you\n",
            "if she does question her phone\n",
            "ask her\n",
            "the only way you will know if your girlfriend is cheating on you is to ask her\n",
            "sigh i am a girl and i am online right now looking for solutions to something last night that i should not have done the whole cheating thing where she does question your calls and blah blah does never apply for me i did something terrible last night that went against my own rules while i was drunk and here i am going crazy over it i want to see my boyfriend and i am scared to tell him i do ignore if i should we re in a long distance three year relationship and he is the best thing that is ever happened to me why did i cheat on him last night because there was a physical attraction between me and a guy here at college that has been producing sexual tension ever since i met him it was great when it happened but i would never give up what i have with my boyfriend for it it was stupid of me and i hate myself right now i let myself down and my boyfriend and i desperately want to see him again what our interaction will be at that point i am not sure we trust each other i know he would never cheat on me and he knows i would never cheat on him i knew i never would cheat on him and here i am hating myself the point is if someone cheats guy or girl it depends on your relationship with them if you are suspicious and want to know how you can tell if she is cheating then already there is something wrong but if she is acting funny and you know she would never do this to you it is a possibility that it is eating her alive inside so look at your relationship with her and see whether it is worth it or not\n",
            "use the grape vine my brother\n",
            "if you catch her having sex with other dudes\n",
            "no you should not tell her it is there business i know its tough and you want to but it is not your business to tell her guys and girls both cheat sometimes it is sad and awful but that is life she will probably eventually find out some other way your brother is your family and you do not want to start problems maybe if you still feel like telling her have her find out some other way that do obviate you or your friends or family and that it do not come back on good luck and take care\n",
            "that s a difficult questionit depends n what you are willing to deal with personally what your brother is doing is terrible but horribly commonplace should she know absolutely the question is are you willing to damage your relationship with your brother depending on how old he is he will likely get over the betrayal of you telling his girlfriend the truth but in the meantime his motto would be to keep out did you personally witness cheating did he tell you or did you suspect it if you personally witnessed it and you feel she might be in some danger std s etc confusion perhaps try to remind your brother of the very selfish danger he is putting her in i know it is hard but remind him how angry and hurt he would feel if she betrayed him it is up to you whether or not to confront him or her but you have many options could you tell a parent and have them talk to him without him knowing it was youconfusion it s true it is their business but the people being hurt rarely like to be the laughing stock as everyone stands around them and wonders\n",
            "listen to lisamarie that is one of the best answers i have seen on blurtit\n",
            "come on if you say he is your brother and you care about him you should tell him whats wrong in his relationship but if you keep it to yourself you are not being loyal to him\n",
            "no you should not tell her that you need to remain loyal to your brother in this regard no matter how hard that may be and no matter how much he does stupid things hopefully he will eventually come around and realize he needs to get his act together\n",
            "guys listen carefully if you will never commit in a relationship please never be in it being liberal is a disease that does not have cure i meant cancer you hear anytime you cheat on somebody that dsz will never go why you have planted a seed and all it needs is your thought\n",
            "don t get involved that will just create drama your brother will just get mad at you and that will start a whoe other problem your not the one who is at fault so you should not have to clean up after your brother however you should try to convince your brother to tell his girlfriend the truth hope this helps good luck\n",

            "there s nothing that you can do about your height growth hormone works varied on it is own it has nothing to do with relatives or anything else either but still you can follow some factors to make sure you are trying be hopeful that might helps you through your growing process make sure enough protein vitamin calcium getting into your body just a good nutrition is crucial get plenty of sleep the ideal would be hours get plenty of water daily never let your body gets dehydrated do stretches each morning right after you wake up also during the day follow get valid yoga movements which that might help for growing as well do pull ups also products such as turnips collard green green beans broccoli known as products that might impress the growth hormone all i said above they are not helpful they are only a hope of doing something controlling our lifestyle doing something is better than doing nothing plus there has been several examples that those factors some other as well helped some people in some way tip hopefully you did not lift heavy weight in your growing age doing heavy weights on workout in growing age will stunt your growing process tip all the human hormones will continue growing till the age of that is where everything in a human will finish developing now usually people will finish growing on but sometimes growing hormones will not finish in age but it will continue along other hormones till tip mostly hormones grow very varied you grow some height you stop then you will grow beard while most of people in your age has no beard but you are shorter than most of the males in your age then you have beard but your voice is undeveloped fully but others have manly voices taller but no beard then suddenly they stop growing but you just start growing suddenly get taller than all of them what i mean is the hormones get developed without any specific routine so you have to check to have a healthy lifestyle be patient with yourself example i know someone being while he is been below when he reached his he grown height reached then in age of turned\n",

            "if i were you i would give up on this idea simply do forget about it exercise and eat a lot of protein keep my head up high and a straight posture like mentioned above don t obsess over it because in my observation even if you grow an inch or two more you will never be quite satisfied if your goal is to become truly tall\n",

            "today most unfortunately more and more women have started to suffer from hair loss and balding a problem that was completely associated with middle aged and pot bellied men in the past experts say that they have started to treat patients suffering from hair loss who are as young as fifteen or sixteen a time when the girls are in their prime of life and health as you must be aware hair grows at the rate of one half inch every month and after a certain period of time ranging from two to six years it goes into a state of rest after which it starts to fall out from the hair follicle this all happens so that a new hair can start to grow from the same place but for some women androgens are present in abundance and when this happens the natural cycle gets interrupted and a build up of dihydrotestosterone or dht takes place this causes the woman to lose hair experts say that it is vital to maintain hygiene on one s scalp and when your scalp is oily it may well lead to the formation of dandruff which in turn will lead to more hair loss however this in itself is not a cause for hair loss\n",
            "a number of things can cause excesivehair loss for example about or months after an illness or a major surgery you may suddenly lose a large amount of hair this hair loss is related to the stress of the illness and is temporary hormonal problems may cause hair loss if your thyroid gland is overactive or underactive your hair may fall out this hair loss usually can be helped by treatmenthyroid disease hair loss may occur if male or female hormones known as androgens and estrogens are out of balance correcting the hormone imbalance may stop your hair loss\n",
            "most people will experience hair loss in their lives oily hair most likely has nothing to do with it but it is hard to say some people will lose a lot more than others and it applies to both women and men women who lose hair in their younger years could have thyroid issues which increases stress and consequently depletes essential vitamins and minerals this alone could cause significant hair loss in women no matter their age basically some stress whether it is due to an illness or other not has the potential to cause hair loss in anyone hair loss is often much more dramatic and noticeable in men but it can still be a disconcerting because it is hard to know the exact cause without seeing a professional many people use special shampoos and treatments to help stimulate regrowth and to prevent hair from falling out sample hime or something similar and see if this helps\n",

            "she s a beast and he should finally leave her all you ever hear is stories about them fighting he married her when he was pretty much unknown and he has totally outgrown her as his popularity grew she became more and more resentful of his fame and all of his female fans time to move on bilie you can do much better than her\n",
            "whoever is the guest who posted that bilie s female fans are skanks and groupies you should be ashamed of yourself and i can disbelieve you call yourself a green day fan when you say something like that about other green day fans nobody has poisonous jealousy for adriene she is quite unattractive and over weight nobody would have reason to be jealous of her bilie should divorce her before he loses all is fans\n",
            "noi do forget they are getting divorced he still seems to be married to minnesota fats although the majority of fans just wish he would dump her sorry ass already it was said a couple of years ago that they came close to divorcing and most fans were hoping he would have just gone through with it she is a fat nasty pig and bilie deserves so much better than the monster he is married to\n",
            "i think bilie only adds fuel to the fire by being so public about his fights with her i have heard rumors for years about their getting divorced personally i think he should just divorce her already he s way too good for her i think she is very resentful of bilie s popularity and is very unkind to his female fans besides being the ugliest woman on the planet she is also the phoniest woman on the planet and she is very much full of herself i was at a record signing for green day this past tour she was walking around like she was some kind of celebrity like people were actually there to see her but in reality everyone was just like where s bilie she was nice to you if you were a parent or a child but she was absolutely rude to anyone who was in their twenties or early thirties and was attractive any of those pretty girls she just rolled her eyes and scowled at them it really looked as if she was going threw the crowd to check out who was going up to her husband i just moved as far as i could to get away from her she looks very sloppy and dirty and i was afraid a lice bug would pop out of her hair and jump onto me i was not at all impressed by her behavior i have no idea what bilie see in her she looks like a monster and she is not even a nice person if he is not divorcing her he should she will eventually turn off all his fans and train wreck his career he deserve so much better\n",
            "i heard that they are actually separating i am not sure if it is divorce or if they are just separating personally i think bilie should just leave her he can do so much better i do forget it is jealousy on the part of the female fans at all rather i think it is jealousy on her part towards the female fans bilie has become a huge star and i think she knows he can do a lot better than her and takes it out on his female fans i think she is resentful of his success and tries to keep the attractive female fans away from him as much as possible i have seen her up close and in person and she is the most unattractive woman alive she is also a complete phony she is nice to all the kid fans parents with children but completely rude and nasty to all the attractive female fans she should take a hint of bilie fans are female if she keeps being nasty to them he will lose all his fan base i agree if bilie was smart he would just leave her already\n",
            "it has been said that the guns song is really about their impeding divorce many people say that they are no longer together and the sudden sale of the house they have lived in for the past fifteen years is a sure sign of that she is a fat nasty pig and bilie joe should divorce her\n",
            "why can not you guys just accept adriene she is a beautiful woman and absolutely nice most of her haters are just get that bilie would never ever do anything with you he is not a perv his kids are the same age get of your fu in dream cloud and get a real life that is just childish love green day and bilie joe with adriene or just get another favorite band become a real fan or stop being nasty\n",

            "it s funny some of you guys say she is ruining his career how is that so they got married only a year after green day got famous and signed onto reprise if she was ruining his career it would have been bad from the beginning songs like she when it s time pulling teeth minnesota girl about all of green day s love songs are inspired by her bilie even said so himself that he was very suicidal when he was younger and full of empty rage it was only a miracle he met adriene when he did he was not as confident as people thought without her he would be nothing she s done nothing but take excellent care of him and their children as long as he loves her you should be happy for him and should not even think about why they should get a divorced she does refrain all lovey dovey in public because she does not like the attention she likes to keep their love life private and i do absolve her if she was just using him she would have drawn the line years ago when he first had a million dollars not years after she would have took it and left if that was what she wanted they ve been married for years and they truly love each other nothing is ever going to change that i bet my life on it tongue sticking out cheeky playful or blowing a raspberry\n",
            "wow some of you guys are pathetic to be sitting here making crap up you do ignore adriene or bilie joe so why are you making up rumors and for those of you who wonder if she would stay with him if he was poor just remember they met when he was aka in way before green day was as big as they are now their private life has absolutely nothing to do with any of you yes he is famous so yes people are going to be in his business but i guess i do not understand why you all care so much if he gets a divorce it has nothing to do with you happy face smiley\n",
            "it was posted on one day that they are no longer together that certainly would explain why their house was put up for sale all of a sudden during the middle of green days world tour and just when his kids were starting a new school year also when his house was put up for sale and the local papers listed it one of the several of the fan sites put up the article a day later they were all removed it seems they want to divorce quietly\n",
            "i do ignore if they are divorcing but i am so sick of hearing about this droning woman she is not accomplished and has done nothing of merit in her life beside get pregnant at the timeconfusion by an up and coming rock star she would not have a clothing store or a clothing line with out bilie s money or his name behind it no charity would ever be interested in her if she was unmarried to bilie joe armstrong so her accomplishments are really bilie joe s accomplishments as for the way the females fans are treated it is totally disgusting bilie joe needs to wake up and see that a musician is absolutely nothing with out his fans bilie joe said in interviews that before he made it he sold joints for two bucks and if he was not a musician he would probably be a drug dealer this is not made up he actually said all these things in interviews you can look it up confusion i am just wondering when he loses all his fan base and had to return to his former occupation would she still stay with him would she have even been with him if he never made it and was still doing his former occupation chances are i think not she has stayed with him because he is her meal ticket and it stupid girl fans who she is nasty to who are funding her fancy lifestyle if he was smart he would leave her\n",
            "i am not sure if they are divorcing or not i hear some people saying they are and some people saying they aren t i agree with most of the comments above that he should finally leave her already bilie has admitted in concerts and interviews that they have a lot of nasty fights i would tell anyone in that situation that they should just walk away i hardly think that the fans are jealous of her i think it is the other way around she looks like a monster i am sure it bothers her that her husband has so many choices of beautiful women to choose from he bends over backwards to make her happy and she does not seem to appreciate it he should just really dump her already he s career has taken off and he is totally outgrown her he could do much better\n",
            "how is adriene accomplished what has she done with her life other than having bilie joe s children she had a failed clothing line and anything she tried to do she could not have done with out bilie joe s money and she certainly is ugly actually she is quite a horror he should divorce her already i am a little curious how some people on the internet claim to know so many details of their personal life it makes me think that you are not just some random person because no fan could possibly know details of his personal life like where he spends christmas and details of his kid s school sounds more to me like you are actually his mrs or someone very close to her and that makes her completely pathetic no wonder she is turning away bilie s fans by the drove\n",
            "i have not heard anything official that they are divorcing so i do forget so but i do agree with the majority of the comments on here that he should have left her a long time ago probably around the time he wrote the song redundant she is definitely holding his career back and will ultimately just destroy it because she seems to be turning off so many of his fans and the likely hood of bilie having a solo career or having any success with a solo project is highly unlikely as long as he is involved with her i guess bilie just does not realize how many of his fans are female and how this monster he is married to is just turning people off green day he will wake up when he sees all his fans are gone i love bilie joe with all my heart he s a brilliant musician and a hell of a good looking guy be i will negate his wife s fancy lifestyle anymore anyone who is that nasty to fans does not deserve it it makes me so sad that bilie joe has to suffer because of this horrible woman\n",
            "i am not really sure if they are divorcing or not but you can not go by what you see on tv or what the media says they claim so many celebrity couples are so happy and in love and the truth is actually quite the opposite e g brad pitt jenifer aniston tiger woods and his mrs so i think you will never really know the truth i did see on another website that the song last night on earth is actually an admission to bilie having an affair if you listen to the words it only states you are the moonlight of my life someone you can only see at night or in secret it does not state you are my everything day and night and the whole song refers to love being sent to someone who is obviously not close to him so maybe they are not divorcing but maybe there is someone else\n",
            "most people are saying that they are divorcing she was not with him at the american music awards and many people are saying that bilie looked very angry and upset at the awards besides bilie has given his fans many reasons to believe their is trouble in his marriage with all the tales of the fights he has had with her if he is not divorcing her he should she looks like medusa bilie seriously has to have a talk with her about personal hygiene and cleanliness she s a dirt bag she looks like she has never bathed in her life and there is lice in that nasty hair of hers bilie can do much better than that ugly nasty pig\n",
            "i heard they are always fighting and their is a lot of talk about a divorce but thank you for letting us know that they are building another house closer to the boys school i know now to stop buying everything green day related i do forget that fat slob of a woman deserves a big fancy house and i do not want my money contributing to fancy houses cars or schools for her brats she is incredibly nasty to the female fans of green day and ultimately will destroy bilie s brilliant career he is stupid and apparently blindconfusion for staying with her\n",
            "adriene will not divorce bilie because she is so fat and ugly she could not get anyone else even if she tried bilie will not leave her because she is the only woman dumb and pathetic enough to stay with him when he admits that he is attracted to other men and makes out with men right in front of her ever notice that she has a problem with all the female fans but never has issue with him kissing other men he s gay people she is just a beard for him\n",
            "there are all kinds of rumors going around about bilie joe including that he is leaving green day and going solo i think it is absolutely hysterical that this man thinks he can actually have a solo career when his wife is turning his fans off by the dozen i do agree with the comment that it makes absolutely no sense to show a married man with kids so much attention i think that all the fans should give his wife exactly what she wants and leave him alone see what kind of career he will have then let him retire to that fancy house he is building closer to his kids school but the fans should definitely stop funding his fat hog of a wife s fancy lifestyle and kid s fancy schools\n",
            "honestly who really cares i agree with all little fan girls tht bilie is hawt but hes also obviously in love with adriene if he is not then fine yay bilie joe but let them b now if you really his fans o and by the way do not stop buying gd merch just because you h his wife your ruining billies life\n",
            "there are some rumors going around that the song guns is about adie and bilie joe getting a divorce but bilie has not said anything about the rumors to deny or confirm them\n",
            "you people are awful adriene seems like a lovely woman and certainly is attractive i smell jealousy\n",
            "i think he should divorce adriene she is a fat disgusting worthless piece of s t\n",
            "well sorry to be so blunt but if mentioning to journalists how bad your marriage is to earn more money then that is pathetic there s better ways to earn money like a paper boy for example c mon bilie are you serious dude\n",
            "hminteresting conversation i do forget they are getting divorced or anything but i do agree that she is is definitely killing his career she seem to be the yoko ono of green day i have heard that she is very nasty to the female fans and in regards to the comment above that adriene needs to keep the skanks and bitches at bay that alone is reason for bilie to lose every fan he has i have never in my life heard of any spouse of a rock star refer to the female fans of the group as skanks and bitches is this lady for real girls listen to me you are all smart strong women who do not have to take these derogatory insults from the wife of a rock star and i do disbelieve for one moment that anyone is jealous of her she is without a doubt the ugliest woman on the planet i think you should all just give her what she wants and just ignore her husband she has been insulting to some of you so stop voting for green day in awards stop buying their albums and stop attending their concerts believe me that will get your message across stronger than all the venting that is being done here no rock star who allows his wife to treat deserves to have fans and if he is as happily married as they say he is is not chasing a married man with children absolutely fruitless focus on a rockstar or band that will appreciate your attention\n",
            "there were all kinds of rumors that the song guns was about their getting a divorce but bilie has not confirmed or denied the rumors he should divorce her he is much too good for her she s fat and ugly and he could do much better than her and it is a bit strange that he would put up his house for sale while he is in the middle of a world tour he has lived there for so many years it would just make more sense to sell it when the tour was over but it mysteriously went on the market in september just when his kids were starting school and he was about to leave for several months to europe and asia the timing just seems very odd a separation or possible divorce from adriene would explain the house being put up for sale all of a sudden in any case she is a loser and he is much better off without her\n",
            "a good reason how about the fact that bilie admits that they fight like cats and dogs sounds to me like he does hate her he just hangs around for the kids and nobody is jealous of her she is a fat disgusting slob why would anyone be jealous of her the only thing i could say to the last response is if bilie does not care about losing his fans then he should he admitted in an interview he was unhappy being the stay at home suburban dad so let him go back to being that or what ever the hell he was before he made it i think he was a bus boy or something let s see if she stays with him when he is a bus boy again as a matter of fact the last answer just made me think i was so stupid to be a fan of his if bilie does not care about his fans he does not deserve to have them and i we should be smart to support groups who do care about his fans\n",
            "i do forget they are divorcing but he probably should leave her i am just curious why when some of you said that you have experienced her being nasty to you why you still support bilie joe the way you do really what smart modern woman gives her full attention to a man who is wife is nasty to them why i would not give him the time of day if that were the case and if he is as happily married as some of these posts say then is not absolutely fruitless showing a married man with children attention use your time energy and attention elsewhere either on yourselves or on someone who appreciates it believe me bilie joe is not the end all to everything there are plenty of bans and rock stars out there who would love you for half the attention you give bilie joe this woman has been crying and belly aching for you to leave her husband alone give her what she wants wasting your precious attention on him\n",
            "i do forget they are getting a divorce but i think he should leave her i have to be honest even the guys are sick and tired of hearing about this whining ugly woman she is severely hurting green day s popularity with the women and if bilie was smart he would see that sometimes i think she would differ happy until she completely ruins his career bilie is one of the most gifted songwriters of our generation it is so sad that such a genius is having his career ruined by a miserable spouse there was even rumors going around about bilie wanting to start a solo career i think the success of a solo career is highly unlikely as long as he is married to her i also worry about the popularity of green day suffering because of her i think most fans would be happy if she would just go away\n",
            "i think most of the fans think that he should just finally dump her she is totally turning off his fans and most fans can not stand her and are turning their back on bilie joe because of her green day put out an amazing album with century breakdown but yet other than guns none of their singles seem to be charting many fans are no longer voting for green day in fan based awards or polls and most fans are saying they will not see this new musical project of theirs because they refuse to support his fat slob wife s fancy lifestyle anymore she is already hurting his career and green day s success personally i think he should dump her sorry ass before she totally kills his career all together\n",
            "who are all these people saying that they are divorcing i have heard nothing of the sort in fact they were just pictured holding hands and looking quite in love while bilie and crew were in australia maybe they fight but that does not mean they are divorcing many married couples fight but they still love each other at the end of the day\n",
            "i think most people agree that bilie should have dumped her years ago but i do not understand why some of you girls let her bother you so much she is fat monstrously ugly and i do not any of you should be giving her the time of day i would say the best thing to do is to not give her any attention just act like she does not exist if anything you should pity poor bilie for having to be married to such a beast\n",
            "oh my god people honestly st of all if they have split up then why on earth is she on tour with them with all their kids in tow too adriene is lovely we waved at her in london at the gig on the barrier and she waved back loads at us and smiled a lot her kids where also there why would she be stood side stage watching bilie and the boys if they have split up they are happy together stop spreading malicious sad gossip and grow up they re married i doubt after all this time they re split up so get a a life\n",
            "adriene is the best girl that you can see so i just can say you are nasty jealous because there are a lot of girls jealous of her they w l never divorce and adie is the best g rl he loves her you can understand by songs sentences they are the best cut it out\n",
            "ok so this is an old post but i am so angry i am gon na have my say as the saying goes better late than never this is disgusting you people call yourselves fans and you are slagging of the woman he loves you re all just jealous bit es because you wish you could have him yourselves they ve been married years and hopefully will still be married in another years and those who do not like it can f off i think they make a lovely couple\n",
            "they should all she cares about is trying to get attention and fame off the back of bilie joe and the kids regarding the fact that it was a manager led intervention last year it only prooves she does not care about him as a person they only reason why the fans think she is a celebrity is because of her attention seeking and desperate need for the limelight because she enjoys it doing interviews and getting flimed for documentaries and how bilie joe seems to never get passed an interview without mention her she has worked with charities but as a celebrity and has made green day fundraise and campaign for the charities she supports she tweet to interact with green day fans and to tweet about her sons and bilie she doesnt tweet about herself she is just an attention seeker who has succeed into getting the attention she thinks she deserves stop bullying other fans into giving her attention as its out of order no fan should have to give a wife of a rock star attention in order to be allowed to be a fan of a band that they are wholly of and milks for attention if bilie joe died she would milk his death for attention she is has narcissistic personality disorder and anyone who can see her for what she is are going to get abused and i can not forgive a manager led intervention bilie joe should differ grovelling to her it should be the other way around she is staying with him for attention status and fame and the lifestyle she is also very manipulative as she has manipulated enough people to enable and back up her delusions of grandeur and yes i do agree with the label of the yoko ono of green day as she will not stop and is allowed to get attention off of bilie joe and his success and is allowed to interfere if she is so deperate for attention and fame can not she do it properly by signing to an agent to be an official celebrity she so desperately wants to be off the back of bilie joes career its his choice to stay with someone who does this and and she tweeted about an addictive perscription pill more than once and then went through her twitter deleting them epic fail if he truly wants to be drink and drug free a radical change is needed but its obvious why he sticks with her and remember she came out of a punk scene too and was not straight edgeso go figure the fan shouldnt even know who she is its ultimitately both their fault by letting her get attention in the first place and for being so public about their relationship all she cares about is the limelight and the attention that people give her she is not only in love with herself but in love with the limelight she makes me want to puke and more importantly what really annoys me is that there are enough sychophants to bully anyone who is rational enough to see her for what she is a limelight loving attention seeker using her family and grabs every oporunity she can to turn the attention and limelight onto her including all the interviews and the publicity etc at some point in the communication thread whether it is the journalist that drops or she allows for the journalist to drop publicity for that eco shop she has at some point bilie joe armstrong name is dropped and uses emilys army for gaining attention too also there are plenty of eco and fairtade and handmade artiscan shops around the oakland and san franisco area so why does her shop get so much attention and publicity\n",

your medical records and diagnostic information in order to help decide if you have whiplash if there was another negligent party and how much to file a compensation claim for whiplash diagnoses can be hidden in obscure diagnoses like cervical strain cervical sprain or flexion extension injury to the neck make sure your car accident compensation solicitors have the right diagnosis when dealing with your claim when you are injured with suspected whiplash injuries you need to assess the degree of your symptoms if you have severe symptoms make sure you keep your head completely still until the emergency medical services or ems arrives they will put you into a cervical collar and a long spine board and will transport you by ambulance to the nearest emergency room there you will be seen by an emergency room physician in mild cases the doctor skips doing an immediate x ray he or she will feel all the muscles of the neck and shoulders for stiffness swelling and tenderness the doctor will look for abrasions cuts and bruising you l often see an abrasion or bruising on the shoulder and upper chest because of the seat belt or because of an airbag injury the doctor may remove the cervical collar and if there is minimal tenderness of the back of the neck he or she will check the range of motion of the neck both passively and actively in other words he or she will move your neck around without your help to see how stiff it is and will then ask you to tip your head forward backward side to side and have you twist the neck he or she will ask you to squeeze their fingers to check to make sure your upper extremity strength is good and will have you move your legs against resistance in case there is a problem with your lower extremity strength sensation of your body will be tested sometimes by poking the skin with a sharp object to see if you have sensation your deep tendon reflexes in your ankles knees wrists and elbowsconfusion will be checked to see if they are normal doctors who are suspicious of a more serious injury will begin by ordering a plain film of the neck from the front and side if these are normal many doctors will remove the cervical collar and allow you to move your neck about if there is still a suspicion of a more serious injury such as a cervical cord injury or fracture to the cervical spine the doctor will do further testing such as a ct scan computerized tomographyconfusion or mri scan magnetic resonance imagingconfusion in order to get a better look at the neck including the muscles an mri exam will outline the muscles better than a ct scan which will need contrast to outline the spinal cord if there is any question of nerve damage the doctor might go on to order an emg or electromyogram this is a nerve conduction test that tells if there are any pinched nerves involved or damage to any peripheral nerve this could mean that swollen muscles tendons or ligaments are impinging on nerves and affecting the function of the nerve most people take about two weeks to recover their whiplash symptoms so they feel normal the rest recover over several months to a year about percent of people still have symptoms after two years and are considered to have chronic symptoms let your car accident compensation solicitor know if you have chronic symptoms because this will affect the amount of the compensation claim you receive chronic symptoms will generally pay more money than symptoms which eventually resolve if your symptoms last longer than two weeks or are considered severe you may be referred to a physiatrist or to a physical therapist a physiatrist is a doctor that is trained in the way the body moves especially after injury a physical therapist is specially trained to evaluate and treat musculoskeletal injuries like whiplash injuries these professionals will re evaluate you they will examine your active and passive range of motion to see how strong the neck is and how stiff it might be your range of motion includes forward movement backward movement sideways tilt and rotational motion of your neck they will also assess your strength in your arms legs and trunkconfusion your sensation in all parts of the bodyconfusion and your deep tendon reflexes any abnormalities will be noted on your record before the professional begins treatment treatment often begins with deep tissue massage using electrical stimulation or hand work then the practitioner works to increase the range of motion of the neck in all directions focusing especially on the trouble spots the practitioner can do things like pressure point work that puts deep pressure on a small area of a muscle and allows the muscle to release and be less tense strengthening exercises are done to get your muscle tone back in a more normal way and things like ice and heat are used to relieve inflammation in more serious cases a physiatrist might inject a muscle with hydrocortisone fluid in order to break down the inflammation in that particular muscle that sort of treatment helps but is rarely done because whiplash involves such a large area of the neck\n",

in the first place this is necessary if you seriously want to get lean and stay lean without elaborating you get fat anytime you consume more calories than your body burns in a day calories are contained in different quantities in all types of foods that we eat and drink and they provide energy for your body to do everything for example a small size bar of chocolate contains a lot more calories than a big apple therefore eating lots of chocolate will result in a large amount of calories accumulating in your body quickly any time your total daily calorie intake is more than your total daily energy expenditure you will gain weight some foods contain a lot more calories than others therefore they will make you fat faster whenever you eat lots of calories and do not use them all up burn energyconfusion mainly because you did unmake enough physical activity the extra calories will be stored as fat consuming more calories than the amount your body needs to maintain it s weight is also known as a calorie surplus a calorie surplus normally leads to weight gain because if the body is not using up calories it will store them and unles you do proper resistance training to build muscle with the extra calories they will be stored as fat to put it in a simple equation more calories in less calories out weight gain more calories out less calories in weight loss resistance exercise plus weight gain muscle mass gain with possibly some fatconfusion weight gain with no resistance exercise mostly fat stored so the above shows that calories consumed in excess results in weight gain because the extra calories are misused up by the body to supply for energy demands and it also shows that the only way weight gain would differ mostly fat stored is when resistance training is applied to build muscle mass with the extra calories how to lose fat is to make use of the right diet and exercise plan to achieve a caloric deficit a caloric deficit is a must to lose fat

food and cook it they had a very low intake of carbs and protein and thus were unintentionally running on ketones converting stored fat into energy is hardwired for our survival and a natural part of human existence your body burns fat to use and produce ketones whenever glucose sources are low or depleted such as during fasting after prolonged exercise when you eat a ketogenic diet lipase an

unemployment takes place so many crimes are automatically be created pakistanis the asian country has many of problems in these days and unemployment is one of those unemployment is caused numerous problems for its people pakistan has incalculable natural resources but problem is that resources are being wasted since the independence of pakistan in the people of pakistan are considered extremely brilliant and hardworking in the world and there is no significance of talent in pakistan therefore it is the reason many of engineers doctors scientifics technicians and accountants travel in foreign countries for earn their livelihood due to unemployment the living standard of pakistanis is going down with the passage of time people are unable to fulfill their basic needs there are plenty of causes behind unemployment some of the major causes of unemployment are as falowing lack of nation employment policy there has been lack of national employment policy in pakistan so no specific policy was lay dawn to remove unemployment there have been no serious efforts at man power paining due to the lack of the policy the unemployment problem has reached to its peak slow growth of pakistan economy the increase in employment opportunities is intimately related to growth of economy despite that more than decades of planning the pakistan economy is going dawn or in law rate privatization of governmental agencies one of the major causes of unemployment is also the privatization of governmental agencies when the government agency become private they mostly higher new employees and fire the current employees due to that many people become unemployed poor education system the educational system of pakistan is very poor since unfortunately any government since independence did not take remarkable steps to make the education system good education system in pakistan is uneven it has been seen even brilliant students left study due to wrong system you can many technical educational colleges and private technical institutions are being found which are only selling degrees because technical education which is being given in these institutions has no value therefore people are wondering about for jobs due to lack of experience and skills rapid growth of population the rapid growth of population in pakistan is one of the most serious issues regarding unemployment the population of pakistan is increasing at very high rate this time according to the statistical the population of pakistan is increasing at the rate of there are many reasons responsible for overpopulation such as early marriages illiteracy desires for sons lack of awareness lack proper family paining etc as we all know that theducation system of pakistan is very poor therefore increasing in population means to bring more uneducated person into the field of labor government or any other company can not provide jobs or work places to this large number of uneducated people at time terror activities one of other most serious cause of unemployment in pakistan is terrorism terrorist activities are on peak at this time in all around of pakistan therefore situation in pakistan is really threatening and alarming and due to this the nationals and as well as foreigners are frightened to invest in pakistan so when investors will divest so how can job or earning opportunities are being created arrival of afghan refugees arrival of afghan refugees to pakistan is the further problem of unemployment in pakistan these refuges are in pakistan since after the attack of russia due to this many of afghans migrated to pakistan for making them save till the betterment situation of their country and the number of these refuges increased after american army attacked on afghanistan in about years ago and the situation in afghanistan is still critical the migrated people cause of unemployment in pakistan uncertainty and unrest in the country insecurity and turbulence in pakistan and the worsening law and order situation has played a chief role in transferring the business to other countries noforeigninvestorsfel safe and sound in investing in such a country in which their businesses

energy are transferring their business in other asian countries like bangladesh india and as well as sri lanka as of this result a huge number of labors are becoming the victims of unemployment

biggest sector of economy that contribute gpd there are two main reason of agricultural backwardness adoption of latest machinery and capital intensive technology the demand of labor has been decreased there is less availability of fertilizers pesticides quality seeds absences of land reform lack of agriculture education absence of merit system in pakistan there is the absence of merit system due corruption in government and private agencies the people who are well qualified and skillful remain unemployed favoritism in politics and lack of plan and management favoritism in politics and lack of plan and management has also given birth to a confusing condition in this regard the favoritism in politics has created environment of self aggrandizement so that everyone is hit with his own interests to a great extent everybody chooses or supports and seconds the party members of its own for certain posts that is why a poor even talented candidate faces joblesnes moreover lack of

threatening and alarming and due to this the nationals and as well as foreigners are frightened to invest in pakistan so when investors will divest so how can job or earning opportunities are being created arrival of afghan refugees arrival of afghan refugees to pakistan is the further problem of unemployment in pakistan these refuges are in pakistan since after the attack of russia due to this

system due corruption in government and private agencies the people who are well qualified and skillful remain unemployed favoritism in politics and lack of plan and management favoritism in politics
